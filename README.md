# spotify-listening-history
This repository is kind of a proof of concept and a first contact with the spotify API, the Process of aquiring the Token is very rudimentary and you need to manually copy it from the URL that gets created when running the program for the first time.

I'm currently rewriting the project in GO and it should be waaaaay better :)

I might add better documentation if someone actually wants it.
